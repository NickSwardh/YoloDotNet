    <PackageReleaseNotes>Hold onto your GPUs, folks! YoloDotNet 2.3 is here, and it's bringing some serious upgrades! Whether you're fine-tuning your models or pushing for peak performance, this update has got you covered. Let's dive in!

Yolo v12 Support – The latest YOLO v12 model is now at your fingertips!

Custom Image Resizing – When creating a dataset for training, preserving small details is crucial. Depending on your dataset, you might get better results by squaring images instead of resizing them proportionally. Now, you can choose between "proportional" resizing (default) to maintain aspect ratio or "stretched" resizing to match the dataset and model input exactly.

SkiaSharp Sampling Options – Fine-tune image resizing like never before! This new option allows you to adjust SkiaSharp´s SamplingOptions, optimizing for either better rendering quality or faster performance. These adjustments can directly impact inference results, influencing detection accuracy and speed. You can tweak it to suit your needs or simply stick with the defaults—your call!

Class Label Filtering – Tired of detecting everything? Now you can filter out unwanted classes and focus only on what matters.

Performance Boosts – Pixel normalization just got even faster. Because every millisecond counts.</PackageReleaseNotes>
