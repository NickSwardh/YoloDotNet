    <PackageReleaseNotes>YoloDotNet 3.0 is here with significant improvements across the board. After careful optimization and refinement, this release delivers faster performance, broader model support, and enhanced usability — making your real-time vision projects smoother and more efficient.

Performance Improvements:
Enjoy up to 70% faster inference and over 90% reduction in memory usage on GPU for segmentation. Other tasks aren’t far behind, with classification running up to 28% faster and memory use cut by nearly 50%, detection speeding up by 25%, and pose estimation boosted by over 27% — all helping your apps run faster and leaner than ever.

Expanded Model Support:
Now supporting a wide range of modern YOLO models, including YOLOv5u through YOLOv12, plus Yolo-World and YOLO-E zero-shot detection, so you can work with the latest and most versatile models available.

Video Processing &amp; Tracking Enhancements:
Video stream handling is simpler and more flexible. Split videos into chunks for batch processing, customize frame intervals to suit your needs, and keep track of objects across frames with the new SORT tracking feature.

Customizable Visual Output:
Tailor your bounding boxes and labels with custom colors and fonts to better fit your project’s style and presentation.

Improved Inference Pipeline:
Run inference directly on SkiaSharp’s SKBitmap and SKImage objects to reduce overhead. Enhanced image resizing and sampling controls help you balance speed and accuracy.

Developer-Friendly Features:
Load ONNX models directly from byte arrays for greater deployment flexibility. Cleaner APIs and helpful inline comments make integration straightforward.</PackageReleaseNotes>
